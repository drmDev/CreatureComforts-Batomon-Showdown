## Reusable one-shot sound player for the mod's OGG files.
##
## Each instance owns one AudioStreamPlayer on the host node, named after its
## file, so several sounds can share a host without stealing each other's
## player. The stream is loaded lazily on the first play, which keeps setup
## cheap and lets the host exist before it is added to the tree.
##
## `enabled` is an optional gate (e.g. the Notification Sounds setting); when it
## returns false, play() is a no-op.
##
## Usage:
##   var click := UiSound.new()
##   click.setup(self, "click.ogg")
##   click.play()
